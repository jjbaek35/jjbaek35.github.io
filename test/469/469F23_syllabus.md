11. **Expected Classroom Behavior**

Arrive on time for class. Excessive tardiness will be subject to sanctions. Under no circumstances should you allow your cell phone to ring during class. Any disruptive behavior, which includes ringing cell phones, listening to your mp3/iPod player, text messaging, constant talking, eating food noisily, or reading a newspaper will not be tolerated. The use of laptops (unless for note-taking), cell phones, MP3, iPods, etc. are strictly prohibited during class.

In group projects or assignments, all students should actively participate and contribute to the outcomes equally without free riders. According to the complaints from the group members, the score of the reported students can be canceled or reduced after one-time warning notifications.

### 

12. **Academic Integrity**

Students in this class must adhere to ASU’s academic integrity policy, which can be found at [https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy)). Students are responsible for reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. In addition, all engineering students are expected to adhere to both the ASU Academic Integrity [Honor Code](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code) and the Fulton Schools of Engineering [Honor Code](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code). All academic integrity violations will be reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO). The AIO maintains record of all violations and has access to academic integrity violations committed in all other ASU college/schools. Specific academic integrity announcements for this class are…[* When discussing sanctions please use language like, recommended sanctions for these violations will be…this allows for the fact that the AIO may want to discuss the sanction with you and it also improves the ability to increase the penalty when it is multiple violations]

Cheating will not be tolerated. Plagiarism, misrepresentation of work, falsification, or any other form of cheating will result in any or all of the following: 1) receiving no credit for the work in question, 2) failure of the course (grade E “failure due to academic dishonesty”), 3) referral to the department administration and/or dean, 4) other disciplinary actions as appropriate to the offense.

To understand your responsibilities as a student read: [ASU Student Code of Conduct](http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/usi/usi104-01.html) and [ASU Student Academic Integrity Policy](http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity/policy).

Students are allowed to use snippets of code found online (e.g., StackOverflow) as long as proper credit for the source is given in a comment in your code AND as long as the snippet does not constitute a significant portion of your code AND as long as the source is not another past or present student of the course.

Posting your assignment code online is expressly forbidden and will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy. Note that this includes working out of a public GitHub repo. The GitHub Student Developer Pack provides unlimited private repositories while you are a student. If you want to impress employers with your coding abilities, create an open-source project that is done outside of class.

17. **Harassment and Sexual Discrimination**

Arizona State University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation for the entire university community, including all students, faculty members, staff employees, and guests. ASU expressly prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by employees, students, contractors, or agents of the university based on any protected status: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and genetic information. Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex are prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs. Mandated sexual harassment reporter: As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.
