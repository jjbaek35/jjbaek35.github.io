I am an Assistant Research Scientist, working for the [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) lab and [Center for Cybersecurity and Trusted Foundations (CTF)](https://globalsecurity.asu.edu/cybersecurity-and-trusted-foundations) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) as. I received my Ph.D. from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp) in South Korea. My research interests lie in the filed of mobile and wireless network security issues like Telco (5G), Access Control, Blockchain, Digital Forensics, and Vehicle security.

## Latest News
 1. Our paper "**Targeted Privacy Attacks by Fingerprinting Mobile Apps in LTE Radio Layer**" has been accepted in [IEEE IFIP DSN  2023 (June 27-30, Porto, Portugal)](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/)  This paper presents novel privacy attacks against LTE using machine learning to identify patterns in the communication between the UEs and eNBs without breaking into users' devices and the base station.

2. Our paper "**SpaceMediator: Leveraging Authorization Policies to Prevent Spatial and Privacy Attacks in Mobile Augmented Reality**" has been accepted in [SACMAT 2023 (June 7-9, Trento, Italy)](https://sacmat2023.fbk.eu/). We present a new approach for managing access control policies in a mobile augmented reality (MAR) application based on policy-governed MAR apps against space invasion, space affectation attacks, and privacy leaks.

3. Our Blockchain Patent application has been issued on Feb. 21, 2023 " S[ystems and Methods for Blockchain-Based Automatic Key Generation](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17067426)" by USPTO. (Patent # 11588631)
