## About Me
<img align=left src="../images/jaejong.jpg"  width="20%">

Hello, I am an Assistant Teaching Professor, working for [SCAI](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} lab <!--- and [Center for Cybersecurity and Trusted Foundations (CTF)](https://globalsecurity.asu.edu/cybersecurity-and-trusted-foundations){:target="_blank"} --> at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) as. I received my Ph.D. from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp){:target="_blank"} in South Korea. My research interests lie in mobile and wireless network security issues like Telco (5G), Access Control, Blockchain, Digital Forensics, and Vehicle security.

## Latest News
1. Our paper ["**It's almost like Frankenstein": Investigating the Complexities
of Scientific Collaboration and Privilege Management within Research
Computing Infrastructures**"](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [46th IEEE Symposium on
Security and Privacy (May 12-15, 2025, SAN FRANCISCO, USA IEEE S&P 2025)](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/){:target="_blank"}. This paper examines security considerations in research computing infrastructures (RCIs) through interviews with experts and stakeholders, highlighting a layered access control approach that challenges traditional models, as collaborative, trust-based sharing raises compliance concerns, and concludes with recommendations to enhance RCI security and flexibility.

2. Our paper ["**PendingMutent: An Authorization Framework for Preventing PendingIntent Attacks in Android-based Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems,**"](../papers/pending-mutent-satcps2025.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems (SaT-CPS 2025)](https://sites.google.com/view/sat-cps-2025), organized in conjunction with the 15th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY 2025)

3. Our paper ["**Unveiling SDN Controller Identity through Timing Side Channel**"](../papers/dsn23.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [15th International Conference on Network of the Future (October 02-04, 2024, Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain)](http://nof.dnac.org/){:target="_blank"}. This paper presents a novel approach to fingerprinting SDN controllers using timing side channels and deep learning techniques.

4. Our paper ["**Targeted Privacy Attacks by Fingerprinting Mobile Apps in LTE Radio Layer**"](https://sefcom.asu.edu/publications/jaejong-dsn23.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [IEEE IFIP DSN  2023 (June 27-30, 2023, Porto, Portugal)](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/){:target="_blank"}.
