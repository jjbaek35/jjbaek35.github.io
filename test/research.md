## Mobile Secuirty

### 4G/5G/6G Security
Identifying security threats and vulnerabilities in 5G network slices based on SDN and NFV and develping Security Reasoning framework to support automatic analysis and conformance testing.
As a complted project, LTE privacy attacks based on machine learning solutions to identify patterns in the communication of commercial LTE networks and revealing the security hole in Wi-Fi calling.

### Vehicle Secuirty
Exploring cybersecurity issues in vehicle, V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything), and automotive such as 5G NAD (Network Access Device) modules and HTA technology (Hardware Trust Anchor).

## Access Management

### Science Access
This project funded by [NSF (#2232911)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2232911){:target="_blank"} and aims to develop ScienceAccess, a federated framework supporting the storage, retrieval, evaluation, and enforcement of AM-Policies that allows scientists and administrators to manage their resource-sharing needs with a high degree of autonomy.
