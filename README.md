## Mission Statement

On advancing my expertise in cybersecurity and undertaking critical challenges,**my goal is to deliver my insights and findings to the pedagogical and research activities**  so that it would tremendously help produce future leaders who would effectively manage our national cybersecurity issues.

## About Me
<img align=left src="../images/jaejong.jpg"  width="20%">

Hello, I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence [SCAI](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} lab. I received my Ph.D. from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp){:target="_blank"} in South Korea. My research interests lie in mobile and wireless network security issues like Telco (5G), Access Control, Blockchain, and Digital Forensics. I donâ€™t aim to be the outstanding instructor or researcherâ€”but I do hope to be an educator who prepares with care and teaches with the conviction that I should always be useful to someone, in some way. â˜• This fall semester 2025, I'll be teaching a total of 5 courses with around 1,000 students. I know it will be physically demanding, so I must remember to prioritize my health. I'll stay committed and teach with a diligent and humble attitude, never taking a single moment for granted.

## Latest News
0. Our paper ["**Mapping the Landscape of Cybersecurity Preparedness: A Systematic Review of Non-Technological Determinants and Consequences**"](../papers/tis_2025.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [Technology in Society](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/technology-in-society){:target="_blank"} on August 20, 2025. This journal paper highlights the importance of these non-technological elements and recommends that future research adopt an integrative approach to better understand their dynamic interplay and long-term consequences.

1. Our paper ["**It's almost like Frankenstein: Investigating the Complexities
of Scientific Collaboration and Privilege Management within Research
Computing Infrastructures**"](../papers/sp2025.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [46th IEEE Symposium on
Security and Privacy (May 12-15, 2025, SAN FRANCISCO)](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/){:target="_blank"}. This paper examines security considerations in research computing infrastructures (RCIs) through interviews with experts and stakeholders, highlighting a layered access control approach that challenges traditional models, as collaborative, trust-based sharing raises compliance concerns, and concludes with recommendations to enhance RCI security and flexibility.

2. Our paper ["**PendingMutent: An Authorization Framework for Preventing PendingIntent Attacks in Android-based Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems,**"](../papers/pending-mutent-satcps2025.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems (SaT-CPS 2025)](https://sites.google.com/view/sat-cps-2025), organized in conjunction with the 15th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY 2025)

3. Our paper ["**Unveiling SDN Controller Identity through Timing Side Channel**"](../papers/nof2024.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [15th International Conference on Network of the Future (October 02-04, 2024, Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain)](http://nof.dnac.org/){:target="_blank"}. This paper presents a novel approach to fingerprinting SDN controllers using timing side channels and deep learning techniques.

4. Our paper ["**Targeted Privacy Attacks by Fingerprinting Mobile Apps in LTE Radio Layer**"](https://sefcom.asu.edu/publications/jaejong-dsn23.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [IEEE IFIP DSN  2023 (June 27-30, 2023, Porto, Portugal)](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/){:target="_blank"}.  This paper presents novel privacy attacks against LTE using machine learning to identify patterns in the communication between the UEs and eNBs without breaking into users' devices and the base station.

5. Our paper ["**SpaceMediator: Leveraging Authorization Policies to Prevent Spatial and Privacy Attacks in Mobile Augmented Reality**"](https://sefcom.asu.edu/publications/jaejong-sactmat23.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been accepted in [SACMAT 2023 (June 7-9, Trento, Italy)](https://sacmat2023.fbk.eu/){:target="_blank"}. We present a new approach for managing access control policies in a mobile augmented reality (MAR) application based on policy-governed MAR apps against space invasion, space affectation attacks, and privacy leaks.

6. Our Blockchain Patent application has been issued on Feb. 21, 2023 [**Systems and Methods for Blockchain-Based Automatic Key Generation**](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17067426){:target="_blank"}" by USPTO. (Patent # 11588631)

7. Our NSF proposal has been awarded on August  29, 2022, **CICI: UCSS: ScienceAccess: Enabling Zero-Trust Resource Access Management for Scientific Collaborations**, which will be collaborated with TAMU-CC. from Oct. 2022 to Sept. 2025. ([Award # 2232911, $591,644](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2232911){:target="_blank"})
